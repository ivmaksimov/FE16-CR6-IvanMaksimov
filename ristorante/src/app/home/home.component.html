        <p class="h4" >Yes, we entered the heart of the Austrians on tiptoe and baking.
            Gambero Rosso is the landing place of a route that started from afar, made of smells, sensations, and indelible memories.</p>
        <p>The selection of the best raw materials, knowledge, and infinite passion, allow me to create a product well rooted in tradition, which consciously embraces the wind of gastronomic innovation, and at the same time caresses the palate, softly and intensely, with sensations of incomparable flavors.</p>
        <p>Hazelnut notes, on the other hand, distinguish the aromas of the final filling. Intense is a rich and complete formula, which allows, with the different kneading techniques and long maturation, to obtain a highly digestible pizza with a sublime taste.</p>

        <p> The use of the best raw materials and its dough with a very high moisture content give its pizza an unprecedented lightness and digestibility.</p>
